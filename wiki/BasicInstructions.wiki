#summary Creating models and succesfully executing the program
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Installation =

  * Install a version of GNU plot -> sudo apt-get install gnuplot
  * Download the most recent executable file from the download tab http://code.google.com/p/fluid-survival-tool/downloads/list or compile your code from the source in the SVN from http://code.google.com/p/fluid-survival-tool/source/checkout .
  * Please report all the bugs, desired features or unexpected behaviour you encounter by creating an new issue http://code.google.com/p/fluid-survival-tool/issues/list .

= Models =

  * Obtain a model from the downloads http://code.google.com/p/fluid-survival-tool/downloads/list or from the SVN http://code.google.com/p/fluid-survival-tool/source/checkout.
  * Each model file describes the places, transitions and arcs of the HPnGs. Above the example models you can find a description of the syntax for each of these. Before understanding the syntax knowledge of the definitions and limitations of HPnGs is required.

= Execution =

  * Assume the executable is in the current folder, run the executable with the command: ./FST path_to_model/modelfilename.m fluid_place_name
  * If GNU plot is installed correctly a 3D plot should pop-up. Also a file is generated that contains the information that is in the plot.
